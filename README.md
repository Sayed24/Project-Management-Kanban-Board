# SmartTask — Kanban Board (Portfolio Project)

Professional Trello-style Kanban board built with vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Features:
- Boards → Lists → Cards
- Drag-and-drop (move cards between lists)
- Color labels, label filter and search
- Card details with description, checklist, comments and due date
- Local persistence using localStorage
- Export / import JSON backup
- Responsive design and modern UI/UX

How to run:
1. Upload `index.html`, `styles.css` and `app.js` to a GitHub Pages repo.
2. Open the GitHub Pages URL (no build step).
3. Use the app — data is saved to localStorage.

Suggested talking points for interviews:
- Explain the data model (boards → lists → cards) and why it's flexible.
- Show the drag-and-drop implementation and how you'd scale it to real-time.
- Mention improvements: backend sync, auth, test coverage, performance tuning.
